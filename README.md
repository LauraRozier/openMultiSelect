**openMultiSelect** provides a multi-select that is compatible with MDBootstrap for Bootstrap v4.

## Disclaimer

This plugin is a one-man job and is developed separately from any other projects. The only help I had was by testing and feedback.  
I used the MDBootstrap and Bootstrap v4 SCSS variables and mixins to try and stick as closely as possible to their styles for future compatibility.  
If there are any issues and/or suggestions, feel free to contact me via an issue on this project or email. (Can be found in the file headers.)
